                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and

                noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.

            <li>
                Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. 
                Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
